# Cline Project Instructions

You are working on a Godot 4 project called "TestVibeGame". This is a 3rd-person spear-throwing game with multiplayer support.

## Project Structure
- **Scripts**: Written in GDScript (`.gd` extension).
- **Scenes**: Godot scene files (`.tscn` extension).
- **Assets**: Located in the root directory (e.g., `icon.svg`).

## Key Files
- `Player.gd` / `Player.tscn`: Player character logic and scene.
- `Spear.gd` / `Spear.tscn`: Projectile logic.
- `World.gd` / `World.tscn`: Main game world and level generation.
- `Enemy.gd` / `Enemy.tscn`: Enemy logic.
- `Mammoth.gd` / `Mammoth.tscn`: Powerful enemy type (Megafauna). Treat as an enemy.
- `Collectible.gd`: Base class for collectibles.

## Multiplayer
- Uses Godot's High-Level Multiplayer API.
- Testing requires running multiple instances (Debug > Run Multiple Instances).
- `GODOT_NETWORKING_DOCS.md` contains detailed networking documentation.

## Development Guidelines
- Follow GDScript best practices.
- Use `class_name` for script classes where appropriate.
- When modifying scenes (`.tscn`), be careful not to break dependencies.
- Use `print()` for debugging network events.

## MCP Tools
- You have access to standard file manipulation and command execution tools.
- Use `read_file` to inspect code.
- Use `replace_in_file` for targeted edits.
- Use `execute_command` to run Godot from the command line if necessary (e.g., `godot --headless` for tests).
